# Reproducibility package (SageMath notebooks)

This GitHub repository provides the **SageMath (Jupyter) notebooks** used in the paper to verify
key symbolic computations. Readers can reproduce the results by downloading the repository and
running the notebooks locally.

Repository: https://github.com/ditf015/trees-with-3-main-eigenvalues

## Requirements

- **SageMath** (tested with SageMath 9.5+; newer versions should also work)
- Jupyter Notebook (ships with SageMath)

> Important: please run these notebooks with the **SageMath kernel** (not a plain Python kernel).
